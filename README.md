# Team Up

Team Up is an Android app prototype designed to provide users with a Tinder-like experience for finding sports teams or teammates. Created as part of the COSC 341 course, this project focused on UI/UX design, involving multiple prototype iterations, focus group requirement gathering, and an extensive process of design evaluation.

## Key Features

1. **Find Teams or Teammates**: Team Up offers a unique platform for individuals to connect with sports teams or fellow players. Whether you are an individual looking to join a team or a team seeking additional players, Team Up provides a convenient and efficient way to find suitable matches.

2. **Tinder-like Matching Experience**: The app utilizes a swipe-based matching system, inspired by the popular Tinder app. Users can view profiles of teams or players, swipe right to express interest, and swipe left to move on to the next option. Mutual matches can then proceed to further communication.

3. **Profile Customization**: Users have the ability to create detailed profiles, showcasing their sports preferences, skill levels, and availability. Teams can provide information about their sport, team culture, and specific requirements for new members. This allows for better matchmaking based on compatibility and shared interests.

4. **Chat and Communication**: Team Up includes a built-in chat feature that enables users to communicate directly with potential teammates or teams. This facilitates the process of getting to know each other, discussing team dynamics, scheduling practices, and coordinating participation in sports events.

5. **User Feedback and Ratings**: After engaging in a team or player interaction, users can provide feedback and ratings based on their experience. This helps maintain a reliable and transparent community, allowing others to make informed decisions when forming new teams or joining existing ones.

## Technologies Used

Team Up utilizes various technologies to deliver a seamless and intuitive user experience. The key technologies involved in the development of the app include:

- **Android Development**: The app was built using Android Studio, the official IDE for Android app development. It leverages the power of Java to create the frontend and backend logic of the app.

- **UI/UX Design Tools**: To design and prototype the app's user interface and experience, a combination of Figma, hand-drawn sketches and paper prototypes have been used.

## Collaborative Effort

Team Up was developed as part of the COSC 341 course, emphasizing UI/UX design principles and practices. The project involved a collaborative effort by the team members, including multiple iterations of prototyping, focus group sessions for requirement gathering, and a meticulous design evaluation process.
